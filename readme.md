### How to Use
---
Link:

The screen will show a Google Map of Phoenix, AZ, with several locations of interest set up as pins on the map. Locations can be chosen by:

1. Clicking on a marker directly
2. Clicking on an item in the list on the bottom right of the screen.

A box will pop up over the chosen marker, giving some information about the location.

The user can also limit the number of displayed markers by typing letters or a word into the Filter List box above the list. This will narrow the markers down to display matching titles only.

Clicking on the down arrow above the list will hide it. Clicking on the up arrow will display the list.

At the bottom the screen is a Flickr icon. When clicked, pictures related to the location are pulled from Flickr photo feeds and displayed for the user in a lightbox format. The user can navigate through these photos using the arrow buttons that appear.
